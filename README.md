**Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an artificial intelligence (AI) solution that aids computers in understanding, interpreting, and manipulating human language. Machine Translation, Conversational AI bots, Resume assessment, Fraud detection, and other applications of NLP are just a few examples. To construct AI-based systems, NLP uses the ideas of tokenization, entity recognition, word embeddings, topic modelling, and transfer learning.**

**The path below is what I followed during my tarining Data Science course, and it helped me tremendously in preparing for the ML interviews. It's also assisting me at work, where I work mostly on NLP and Deep Learning.**

#**Prerequisites to follow the Roadmap effectively**

* Basic Idea of Python programming language.
* Simple Idea of Machine and Deep Learning algorithms.

#**Libraries used while following the Roadmap**

> Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK),
> spaCy
> Core NLP
> Gensim
> PyNLPI,etc.
